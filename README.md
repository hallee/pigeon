## ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! You're here early.

Pigeon is still *very* much a work-in-progress, and it's not ready for production yet. We'd love contributors. Check out the [**project board**](/../../projects/1) for our progress toward a public release.

## What is Pigeon?

Pigeon is a headless CMS. It's a way to easily create structured content with an API to access content from your frontend application.

Pigeon is written in Swift and aims to provide a type-safe and performant API. It provides both JSON and GraphQL endpoints by default.

It's especially geared toward Swift frontends like iOS and macOS apps. You can create a content API with Pigeon and share your data structure between your API server and your application, effectively creating a type-safe bridge.
